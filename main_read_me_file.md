# description
In this file, I am going to write plan and execution status along with links.

# Topic wise content - will be updated repeatedly with new info
## python
## machine learning
## deep learning
## computer vision


# plan 
my plan is to learn computer vision in 3 iterations.
1. learn the missing parts
3. learn advanced concepts in cv
4. learn additional concepts related to software engineering
5. prepare for interview related concepts
6. learning everying from the start
7. prepare resume
8. add on topics while preparing for interviews


   
# execution 



om sairam - jai ganesh - namo venkatesha

1. fitness - daily
2. work - complete weekdays - no personal work or career work - even after hours also
3. only career on holidays - on office work 



complete computer vision road map 
1. python - done - add links here - telusko is done
    even add - cv1/cv2/cv3 videos and https://www.youtube.com/@sreekanthpr - this guys python videos like how variables are stored




2. computer vision with python - cv1 
2. go through concepts of image processing and apply here as well  - image processing basics - mars to hollywood (cv2)
2. image processing basics - learning video - not programming - concepts like connected components/sift/asift - others - get into deep for the projects in mtech
2. pandas tutorials 
2. matplot lib tutorials 
2. numpy tutorials (cv2)

3.0. introduction to machine learning - andrew ng videos in coursera and check basic conects 
     build end to end things without libraries  - andrew ng - basic ml videos - finish quickly if required  - coursera (cv2)
3.0  cnn videos from standford 	 
	 


3. scikit learn tutorial - cv1
3. pytorch tutorial - cv1 
3. basic machine learning projects - cv1
3. doing all the above projects in pytorch and yolov8





add ons:
sql
crash course on git hub (cv1)
computer vision with c++(cv1)
aws/cloud/docker - basics - just to understand the other layers - cv1 
coursera - computer vision videos 
transform learning -alexnet,vgg16, vgg 19 and know these
object detection methods like - yolo and rcnn
complete end to end deployment - need to have idea 
know os library in python - cv2

3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4MLrtOKPjY - cv3
4. some computer vision projects - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-884J2mnOY&list=PLb49csYFtO2GunSHX38EjYHoYYbJYwrB- 
5. ml - learning videos 
6. image processing videos 
7. maths learning videos

for job:
know algorithms and data structures - cv3

MY ROAD MAP:
*** prepare proper list for everything you are referring for cv from now onwards
1. git hub video - Keep writing in it.  Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course  
2. pytorch video - go back to back videos - any in the above list - to get ideas and get clarity of concepts 
3. computer vision 3 hours video - in cv1
4. basic cv machine learning projects - in pytorch/scikit learn / scratch - if possible 

Then start everything from start
	1. Python - no need to learn anything more- learn only on need basis
	2. Image processing + open cv - with python only
	3. ML - with maths and DEEPLEARNING
	4. Computer vision
	5. Additional concepts 
	6. Interview concepts 
	7. Apply for interview - and learn daily


*** prepare proper list for everything you are referring for cv from now onwards
